## Accomplished in March
 
From our Feb work (past report), we were only able to extract 7 out of 9 attributes which were important after doing feature selection during Jan work. We were not able to extract 

- SSLfinal_State - HTTP/HTTPS, Not complete as we don't have access to age of certified domains.

- web_traffic - Not done as we don't have access to Alexa website database.
Phistank dataset contains only positive examples no negative examples. Extracted data from phistank can be found here. Code could be found here

Now question is how much information do we lose because of those 2 features not being extracted.

### Results

- The results could be found in this issue. 
- We only lost about 5% and do not use NB as the classifier. We are still in the range of 90%.

### Admin Work:

- Have received access to IMPACT. Now looking at these datasets.
- Also have access to cert dataset

## Plan of work for April

- Remember we only extracted positive examples. In the extracted data we found about 11 target companies which have samples greater than 20.

- We will goto these 11 companies to randomly select our negative examples. We will try to get equal distribution of positive and negative examples.
- Once we will have created this dataset then we will setup for LACE2 experiment

## Progress towards Stated Goals

|Goal| Status|
|----|--------|
|Learner performance results when learners are applied to (a) raw data or (b) data privatized by LACE | Should have those before summer|
|Learner performance results where learners execute over a stream of data containing sequences of phishing reports (this will test how early we can classify new examples as phishing attacks). | If not May, then early in the Fall when the students get back|
|Measures of the information content within LACE2’s privatized data (this will allow us to assess the effectiveness of LACE2’s privatization. | To do|
|Plots of runtimes vs data sets size for LACE2 (this will test how well this schema scales).|To do. Should not be hard.|
|Plots of runtimes vs data sets sizes for homomorphic encryption (this is an alternate technology to LACE2, with a reputation of being very slow). These runtime plots will allow for a comparative assessment of LACE2 vs alternate methods.|Based on recent seminars at LAS, we no longer think  homomorphic encryption would be the best baseline to compare this work against. Reworking our thinking here. |
