## Accomplished in January
 
We found related datasets for this project. The first dataset is a famous dataset provided by UCI which can be seen and downloaded [here] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Phishing+Websites). The dataset contains about 10,000 samples with 30 attributes defined to find out whether a website is phishing or not. The other dataset which we found is from phistank and can be seen [here] (http://www.phishtank.com/developer_info.php). This only shows the websites prone to phishing attacks. We have to retrieve features based on the first dataset. Now to see whether the first dataset could be a good model, we ran machine learning algorithms to see how good it is. The results could be find out in [here] (https://github.com/ai-se/LAS-Phishing/issues/2). This dataset could be a good predictor. All the source code and reports are available online to be checked ([Repository] (https://github.com/ai-se/LAS-Phishing)).
 
For the work in February, we have to retrieve those 30 attributes from 2nd website which could be a tedious task. We ran a feature subset selection to find out which attributes convey the most to report whether a website is phishing or not. We found out that only 9 out 30 attributes are important and we achieved the same results as with using 30 attributes ([Results] (https://github.com/ai-se/LAS-Phishing/issues/2)).
 
## Plan of work for February

This month would mostly go into writing pattern matching and regular expressions to retrieve those 9 attributes out from 2nd Dataset. Then this could be divided into different regions and work as distributed machine learners which is our aim.
But if we can get a hand of a mock dataset from LAS, then these steps could be achieved faster.
